For the people to stay updated about the COVID-19, I have decided to make this project in which I will show you "How to get the DATA & display the relavant data in your Windows as a notification using some libraries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

I am assuming you all have Python's latest version installed.
The relavant data we need for this project is fetched from [WorldOMeters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) 

#### Install the following libraries:
```
1. Requests
2. Beautiful Soup as bs4
3. Win10Toast
```

#### Installing
```
pip install library_name
```

For example,

```
pip install bs4
```

## Running the Code

Just follow along the code in the jupyter file or .py file.

## Last Words
In the end, I would remind you to be safe and remember prevention is better than cure.
